# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection

## Concept Used
Binary Classification of EEG signal data tried with multiple ML algorithms like Gradient Boost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extreme Random Forest Classification. 

## Dataset

Conclusion: We can use Time Series Data to classify an EEG signal as epileptic or not as we were getting very high accuracies of most of the above tried classification algorithms. This is due to the huge variations in the datapoints as seen in the exploratory analysis before.

All the algorithms yielded very high classification accuracies with Extreme Random Forest having the highest classification accuracy of around 97%
